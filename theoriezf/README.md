# Implementation of Set theory in Dedukti

The implementation of __Set theory__ in Dedukti is composed of several files :

- *logic.lp* that contains the basis of logic

- *language.lp* that contains the defintion of the theory of pointed graphs

- *bisimilarity.lp*, *injectivity.lp*, *eta1.lp*, *eta2.lp*, *eta3.lp* and *membership.lp* that contain lemmas from 3 to 31.

- *nat.lp* contains the definition of natural numbers

- *formulas.lp* contains the development of formulas

- *formulas_lemmas.lp* contains intermediate lemmas that are using formulas

- *lemma32.lp* that contains the proof of lemma 32

- *relocation.lp*, *embedding.lp*, *lemma41.lp*, *finitary.lp*, *infinity.lp* and *closure.lp* that contain the proofs of lemmas 33 to 53

In addition, *weakextensionality.lp* contains the proofs of the theorem prooving weak extensionality.
