- *logic.lp* contains the basis of logic

 - *nat.lp* contains the definition of natural numbers

- *language.lp* contains the defintion of the theory of pointed graphs

- *formulas.lp* contains the development of formulas

- *language2.lp* contains the development of language with formulas

- *bisimilarity.lp*, *injectivity.lp*, *eta1.lp*, *eta2.lp* and *eta3.lp* contain lemmas 3 to 27

- *membership.lp* contains lemmas 28 to 31

- *formulas_lemmas.lp* contains intermediate lemmas that are using formulas

- *lemma32.lp* contains the proof of lemma 32

- *relocation.lp*, *embedding.lp* and *lemma41.lp* contain the proofs of lemma 33 to 41

- *weakextensionality.lp* contains the proofs of the theorem prooving weak extensionality

- *finitary.lp*, *infinity.lp* and *closure.lp* contain the proofs of lemmas 42 to 53.
